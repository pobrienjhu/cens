Networks 

caveman graph (rewire)
erdos-reni ( not sure how realistic) possion random???
power-law (more realistic fat tails, strategic)
ring-lattice (watts strogatz rewire high cluster/low dimensions, is this really any differnet then the caveman graph)
more...

just focus on small worlds??? 
use of real data sets existing network structures???

graph features for data anaylsis/mining

centratlity measures (averages across networks and normalize)
degree
closeness
decay over different delta
betweenenss 
eigenvectors
Bonacich

diffusion centrality
(tweak between bonacich <-> eigenvectors

Random graphs:
diameter
gegree distribution
clustering
